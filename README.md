# SOC Analyst Practice Labs

This repository is used for ongoing, hands-on practice related to **Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst work**.

It contains security challenges and exercises designed to simulate real-world scenarios encountered in defensive security roles. The repository is actively maintained and will continue to grow over time as additional challenges are completed.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate continued learning, practical experience, and engagement with SOC and blue team workflows.
